<H2>ACT I</H2>
<P class=nh>[<I>Madhav's House</I>] 
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> What a state I am in! Before he came, nothing 
mattered; I felt so free. But now that he has come, goodness knows from where, 
my heart is filled with his dear self, and my home will be no home to me when he 
leaves. Doctor, do you think he-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> If there's life in his fate, then he will live 
long. But what the medical scriptures say, it seems-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Great heavens, what? </P><PB N="10"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> The scriptures have it: "Bile or palsey, cold or 
gout spring all alike." </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Oh, get along, don't fling your scriptures at me; you 
only make me more anxious; tell me what I can do. </P>
<P class=h><B>Physician</B> [<I>Taking snuff</I>] The patient needs the most 
scrupulous care. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> That's true; but tell me how. </P>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> I have already mentioned, on no account must he be 
let out of doors. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav</B> Poor child, it is very hard to keep him indoors all day 
long. </P><PB N="11"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> What else can you do? The autumn sun and the damp 
are both very bad for the little fellow--for the scriptures have it: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P class=c>"In wheezing, swoon or in nervous fret,<BR>In jaundice or leaden 
  eyes--" </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Never mind the scriptures, please. Eh, then we must 
shut the poor thing up. Is there no other method? </P>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> None at all: for, "In the wind and in the sun--" 
</P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> What will your "in this and in that" do for me now? 
Why don't you let them alone and come straight to the point? What's to be done 
then? Your system is very, very hard for the poor boy; and he is so quiet too 
with all his <PB N="12"></PB>pain and sickness. It tears my heart to see him 
wince, as he takes your medicine. </P>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> effect. That's why the sage Chyabana observes: "In 
medicine as in good advices, the least palatable ones are the truest." Ah, well! 
I must be trotting now. [<I>Exit</I>] </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Gaffer enters</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Well, I'm jiggered, there's Gaffer now. </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Why, why, I won't bite you. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> No, but you are a devil to send children off their 
heads. </P><PB N="13"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> But you aren't a child, and you've no child in the 
house; why worry then? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Oh, but I have brought a child into the house. </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Indeed, how so? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> You remember how my wife was dying to adopt a child? 
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Yes, but that's an old story; you didn't like the 
idea. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> You know, brother, how hard all this getting money in 
has been. That somebody else's child would sail in and <PB N="14"></PB>waste all 
this money earned with so much trouble--Oh, I hated the idea. But this boy 
clings to my heart in such a queer sort of way-- 
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> So that's the trouble! and your money goes all for him 
and feels jolly lucky it does go at all. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Formerly, earning was a sort of passion with me; I 
simply couldn't help working for money. Now, I make money and as I know it is 
all for this dear boy, earning becomes a joy to me. 
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Ah, well, and where did you pick him up? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> He is the son of a man who was a brother to my wife by 
village ties. He <PB N="15"></PB>has had no mother since infancy; and now the 
other day he lost his father as well. </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Poor thing: and so he needs me all the more. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> The doctor says all the organs of his little body are 
at loggerheads with each other, and there isn't much hope for his life. There is 
only one way to save him and that is to keep him out of this autumn wind and 
sun. But you are such a terror! What with this game of yours at your age, too, 
to get children out of doors! </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> God bless my soul! So I'm already as bad as autumn 
wind and sun, eh! But, friend, I know something, too, of the game of keeping 
them indoors. When my day's work is over I am <PB N="16"></PB>coming in to make 
friends with this child of yours. [<I>Exit</I>] </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Amal enters</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Uncle, I say, Uncle! </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Hullo! Is that you, Amal? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Mayn't I be out of the courtyard at all? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> No, my dear, no. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> See, there where Auntie grinds lentils in the quirn, the 
squirrel is sitting with his tail up and with his wee hands he's picking up the 
broken grains of lentils <PB N="17"></PB>and crunching them. Can't I run up 
there? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> No, my darling, no. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Wish I were a squirrel!--it would be lovely. Uncle, why 
won't you let me go about? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Doctor says it's bad for you to be out. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> How can the doctor know? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> What a thing to say! The doctor can't know and he 
reads such huge books! </P><PB N="18"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Does his book-learning tell him everything? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Of course, don't you know! 
<P class=h><B>Amal</B> [<I>With a sigh</I>] Ah, I am so stupid! I don't read 
books. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Now, think of it; very, very learned people are all 
like you; they are never out of doors. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Aren't they really? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> No, how can they? Early and late they toil and moil at 
their books, and they've eyes for nothing else. Now, my little man, you are 
going to be <PB N="19"></PB>learned when you grow up; and then you will stay at 
home and read such big books, and people will notice you and say, "he's a 
wonder." </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No, no, Uncle; I beg of you by your dear feet--I don't 
want to be learned, I won't. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Dear, dear; it would have been my saving if I could 
have been learned. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No, I would rather go about and see everything that 
there is. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Listen to that! See! What will you see, what is there 
so much to see? </P><PB N="20"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> See that far-away hill from our window--I often long to 
go beyond those hills and right away. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Oh, you silly! As if there's nothing more to be done 
but just get up to the top of that hill and away! Eh! You don't talk sense, my 
boy. Now listen, since that hill stands there upright as a barrier, it means you 
can't get beyond it. Else, what was the use in heaping up so many large stones 
to make such a big affair of it, eh! </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Uncle, do you think it is meant to prevent your crossing 
over? It seems to me because the earth can't speak it raises its hands into the 
sky and beckons. And those who live far and sit alone by their windows can see 
<PB N="21"></PB>the signal. But I suppose the learned people-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> No, they don't have time for that sort of nonsense. 
They are not crazy like you. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Do you know, yesterday I met someone quite as crazy as I 
am. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Gracious me, really, how so? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> He had a bamboo staff on his shoulder with a small 
bundle at the top, and a brass pot in his left hand, and an old pair of shoes 
on; he was making for those hills straight across that meadow there. I called 
out to him and asked, "Where are you going?" He answered, <PB N="22"></PB>"I 
don't know, anywhere!" I asked again, "Why are you going?" He said, "I'm going 
out to seek work." Say, Uncle, have you to seek work? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Of course I have to. There's many about looking for 
jobs. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> How lovely! I'll go about, like them too, finding things 
to do. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Suppose you seek and don't find. Then-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Wouldn't that be jolly? Then I should go farther! I 
watched that man slowly walking on with his pair of worn out shoes. And when he 
got to where the water flows under the fig tree, he <PB N="23"></PB>stopped and 
washed his feet in the stream. Then he took out from his bundle some gram-flour, 
moistened it with water and began to eat. Then he tied up his bundle and 
shouldered it again; tucked up his cloth above his knees and crossed the stream. 
I've asked Auntie to let me go up to the stream, and eat my gram-flour just like 
him. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> And what did your Auntie say to that? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Auntie said, "Get well and then I'll take you over 
there." Please, Uncle, when shall I get well? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> It won't be long, dear. </P><PB N="24"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Really, but then I shall go right away the moment I'm 
well again. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> And where will you go? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Oh, I will walk on, crossing so many streams, wading 
through water. Everybody will be asleep with their doors shut in the heat of the 
day and I will tramp on and on seeking work far, very far. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> I see! I think you had better be getting well first; 
then-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> But then you won't want me to be learned, will you, 
Uncle? </P><PB N="25"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> What would you rather be then? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I can't think of anything just now; but I'll tell you 
later on. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Very well. But mind you, you aren't to call out and 
talk to strangers again. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> But I love to talk to strangers! </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Suppose they had kidnapped you? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> That would have been splendid! But no one ever takes me 
away. They all want me to stay in here. </P><PB N="26"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> I am off to my work--but, darling, you won't go out, 
will you? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No, I won't. But, Uncle, you'll let me be in this room 
by the roadside. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Exit Madhav</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> Curds, curds, good nice curds. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Curdseller, I say, Curdseller. </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> Why do you call me? Will you buy some curds? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> How can I buy? I have no money. </P><PB N="27"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> What a boy! Why call out then? Ugh! What a waste of 
time. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I would go with you if I could. </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> With me? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Yes, I seem to feel homesick when I hear you call from 
far down the road. </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman</B> [<I>Lowering his yoke-pole</I>] Whatever are you 
doing here, my child? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> The doctor says I'm not to be out, so I sit here all day 
long. </P><PB N="28"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> My poor child, whatever has happened to you? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I can't tell. You see I am not learned, so I don't know 
what's the matter with me. Say, Dairyman, where do you come from? </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> From our village. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Your village? Is it very far? </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> Our village lies on the river Shamli at the foot of 
the Panch-mura hills. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Panch-mura hills! Shamli river! I wonder. I may have 
seen your village. I can't think when though! </P><PB N="29"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> Have you seen it? Been to the foot of those hills? 
</P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Never. But I seem to remember having seen it. Your 
village is under some very old big trees, just by the side of the red 
road--isn't that so? </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> That's right, child. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> And on the slope of the hill cattle grazing. </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> How wonderful! Aren't there cattle grazing in our 
village! Indeed, there are! </P><PB N="30"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> And your women with red sarees fill their pitchers from 
the river and carry them on their heads. </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> Good, that's right. Women from our dairy village do 
come and draw their water from the river; but then it isn't everyone who has a 
red saree to put on. But, my dear child, surely you must have been there for a 
walk some time. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Really, Dairyman, never been there at all. But the first 
day doctor lets me go out, you are going to take me to your village. </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> I will, my child, with pleasure. </P><PB 
N="31"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> And you'll teach me to cry curds and shoulder the yoke 
like you and walk the long, long road? </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> Dear, dear, did you ever? Why should you sell curds? 
No, you will read big books and be learned. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No, I never want to be learned--I'll be like you and 
take my curds from the village by the red road near the old banyan tree, and I 
will hawk it from cottage to cottage. Oh, how do you cry--"Curd, curd, good nice 
curd!" Teach me the tune, will you? </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> Dear, dear, teach you the tune; what an idea! 
</P><PB N="32"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Please do. I love to hear it. I can't tell you how queer 
I feel when I hear you cry out from the bend of that road, through the line of 
those trees! Do you know I feel like that when I hear the shrill cry of kites 
from almost the end of the sky? </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> Dear child, will you have some curds? Yes, do. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> But I have no money. </P>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> No, no, no, don't talk of money! You'll make me so 
happy if you have a little curds from me. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Say, have I kept you too long? </P><PB N="33"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Dairyman.</B> Not a bit; it has been no loss to me at all; you 
have taught me how to be happy selling curds. [<I>Exit</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal</B> [<I>Intoning</I>] Curds, curds, good nice curds--from the 
dairy village--from the country of the Panch-mura hills by the Shamli bank. 
Curds, good curds; in the early morning the women make the cows stand in a row 
under the trees and milk them, and in the evening they turn the milk into curds. 
Curds, good curds. Hello, there's the watchman on his rounds. Watchman, I say, 
come and have a word with me. </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> What's all this row you are making? Aren't you 
afraid of the likes of me? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No, why should I be? </P><PB N="34"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Suppose I march you off then? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Where will you take me to? Is it very far, right beyond 
the hills? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Suppose I march you straight to the King? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> To the King! Do, will you? But the doctor won't let me 
go out. No one can ever take me away. I've got to stay here all day long. </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Doctor won't let you, poor fellow! So I see! Your 
face is pale and there are dark rings round your eyes. Your veins stick out from 
your poor thin hands. </P><PB N="35"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Won't you sound the gong, Watchman? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Time has not yet come. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> How curious! Some say time has not yet come, and some 
say time has gone by! But surely your time will come the moment you strike the 
gong! </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> That's not possible; I strike up the gong only when 
it is time. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Yes, I love to hear your gong. When it is midday and our 
meal is over, Uncle goes off to his work and Auntie falls asleep reading her 
Râmayana, and in the courtyard under the <PB N="36"></PB>shadow of the wall our 
doggie sleeps with his nose in his curled up tail; then your gong strikes out, 
"Dong, dong, dong!" Tell me why does your gong sound? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> My gong sounds to tell the people, Time waits for 
none, but goes on forever. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Where, to what land? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> That none knows. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Then I suppose no one has ever been there! Oh, I do wish 
to fly with the time to that land of which no one knows anything. </P><PB 
N="37"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> All of us have to get there one day, my child. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Have I too? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Yes, you too! </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> But doctor won't let me out. </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> One day the doctor himself may take you there by the 
hand. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> He won't; you don't know him. He only keeps me in. 
</P><PB N="38"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> One greater than he comes and lets us free. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> When will this great doctor come for me? I can't stick 
in here any more. </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Shouldn't talk like that, my child. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No. I am here where they have left me--I never move a 
bit. But when your gong goes off, dong, dong, dong, it goes to my heart. Say, 
Watchman? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Yes, my dear. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Say, what's going on there in that big house on the 
other side, where <PB N="39"></PB>there is a flag flying high up and the people 
are always going in and out? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Oh, there? That's our new Post Office. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Post Office? Whose? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Whose? Why, the King's surely! </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Do letters come from the King to his office here? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Of course. One fine day there may be a letter for 
you in there. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> A letter for me? But I am only a little boy. </P><PB 
N="40"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> The King sends tiny notes to little boys. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Oh, how lovely! When shall I have my letter? How do you 
guess he'll write to me? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Otherwise why should he set his Post Office here 
right in front of your open window, with the golden flag flying? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> But who will fetch me my King's letter when it comes? 
</P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> The King has many postmen. Don't you see them run 
about with round gilt badges on their chests? </P><PB N="41"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Well, where do they go? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Oh, from door to door, all through the country. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I'll be the King's postman when I grow up. </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Ha! ha! Postman, indeed! Rain or shine, rich or 
poor, from house to house delivering letters--that's very great work! </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> That's what I'd like best. What makes you smile so? Oh, 
yes, your work is great too. When it is silent everywhere in the heat of the 
noonday, your gong sounds, Dong, dong, dong,-- and sometimes when I wake up at 
<PB N="42"></PB>night all of a sudden and find our lamp blown out, I can hear 
through the darkness your gong slowly sounding, Dong, dong, dong! </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> There's the village headman! I must be off. If he 
catches me gossiping with you there'll be a great to do. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> The headman? Whereabouts is he? </P>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Right down the road there; see that huge palm-leaf 
umbrella hopping along? That's him! </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I suppose the King's made him our headman here? </P><PB 
N="43"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Watchman.</B> Made him? Oh, no! A fussy busy-body! He knows so 
many ways of making himself unpleasant that everybody is afraid of him. It's 
just a game for the likes of him, making trouble for everybody. I must be off 
now! Mustn't keep work waiting, you know! I'll drop in again to-morrow morning 
and tell you all the news of the town. [<I>Exit</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> It would be splendid to have a letter from the King 
every day. I'll read them at the window. But, oh! I can't read writing. Who'll 
read them out to me, I wonder! Auntie reads her Râmayana; she may know the 
King's writing. If no one will, then I must keep them carefully and read them 
when I'm grown up. But if the postman can't find me? Headman, Mr. Headman, may I 
have a word with you? </P><PB N="44"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> Who is yelling after me on the highway? Oh, you 
wretched monkey! </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> You're the headman. Everybody minds you. </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman</B> [<I>Looking pleased</I>] Yes, oh yes, they do! They 
must! </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Do the King's postmen listen to you? </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> They've got to. By Jove, I'd like to see-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Will you tell the postman it's Amal who sits by the 
window here? </P><PB N="45"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> What's the good of that? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> In case there's a letter for me. </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> A letter for you! Whoever's going to write to you? 
</P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> If the King does. </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> Ha! ha! What an uncommon little fellow you are! Ha! 
ha! the King indeed, aren't you his bosom friend, eh! You haven't met for a long 
while and the King is pining, I am sure. Wait till to-morrow and you'll have 
your letter. </P><PB N="46"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Say, Headman, why do you speak to me in that tone of 
voice? Are you cross? </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> Upon my word! Cross, indeed! You write to the King! 
Madhav is devilish swell nowadays. He'd made a little pile; and so kings and 
padishahs are everyday talk with his people. Let me find him once and I'll make 
him dance. Oh, you snipper-snapper! I'll get the King's letter sent to your 
house--indeed I will! </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No, no, please don't trouble yourself about it. </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> And why not, pray! I'll tell the King about you and 
he won't be very <PB N="47"></PB>long. One of his footmen will come along 
presently for news of you. Madhav's impudence staggers me. If the King hears of 
this, that'll take some of his nonsense out of him. [<I>Exit</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Who are you walking there? How your anklets tinkle! Do 
stop a while, dear, won't you? </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>A Girl enters</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Girl.</B> I haven't a moment to spare; it is already late! </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I see, you don't wish to stop; I don't care to stay on 
here either. </P>
<P class=h><B>Girl.</B> You make me think of some late star of the morning! 
Whatever's the matter with you? </P><PB N="48"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I don't know; the doctor won't let me out. </P>
<P class=h><B>Girl.</B> Ah me! Don't then! Should listen to the doctor. 
People'll be cross with you if you're naughty. I know, always looking out and 
watching must make you feel tired. Let me close the window a bit for you. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No, don't, only this one's open! All the others are 
shut. But will you tell me who you are? Don't seem to know you. </P>
<P class=h><B>Girl.</B> I am Sudha. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> What Sudha? </P><PB N="49"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> Don't you know? Daughter of the flower-seller here. 
</P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> What do <EM>you</EM> do? </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> I gather flowers in my basket. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Oh, flower gathering! That is why your feet seem so glad 
and your anklets jingle so merrily as you walk. Wish I could be out too. Then I 
would pick some flowers for you from the very topmost branches right out of 
sight. </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> Would you really? Do you know more about flowers than 
I? </P><PB N="50"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Yes, I <EM>do,</EM> quite as much. I know all about 
Champa of the fairy tale and his seven brothers. If only they let me, I'll go 
right into the dense forest where you can't find your way. And where the 
honey-sipping hummingbird rocks himself on the end of the thinnest branch, I 
will flower out as a champa. Would you be my sister Parul? </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> You are silly! How can I be sister Parul when I am 
Sudha and my mother is Sasi, the flower-seller? I have to weave so many garlands 
a day. It would be jolly if I could lounge here like you! </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> What would you do then, all the day long? </P><PB 
N="51"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> I could have great times with my doll Benay the bride, 
and Meni the pussycat and--but I say it is getting late and I mustn't stop, or I 
won't find a single flower. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Oh, wait a little longer; I do like it so! </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> Ah, well--now don't you be naughty. Be good and sit 
still and on my way back home with the flowers I'll come and talk with you. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> And you'll let me have a flower then? </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> No, how can I? It has to be paid for. </P><PB 
N="52"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I'll pay when I grow up--before I leave to look for work 
out on the other side of that stream there. </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> Very well, then. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> And you'll come back when you have your flowers? </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> I will. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> You will, really? </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> Yes, I will. </P><PB N="53"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> You won't forget me? I am Amal, remember that. </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> I won't forget you, you'll see. [<I>Exit</I>] </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>A Troop of Boys enter</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Say, brothers, where are you all off to? Stop here a 
little. </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys.</B> We're off to play. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> What will you play at, brothers? </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys.</B> We'll play at being ploughmen. </P><PB N="54"></PB>
<P class=h><B>First Boy</B> [<I>Showing a stick</I>] This is our ploughshare. 
</P>
<P class=h><B>Second Boy.</B> We two are the pair of oxen. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> And you're going to play the whole day? </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys.</B> Yes, all day long. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> And you'll come back home in the evening by the road 
along the river bank? </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys.</B> Yes. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Do you pass our house on your way home? </P><PB 
N="55"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Boys.</B> You come out to play with us, yes do. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Doctor won't let me out. </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys.</B> Doctor! Suppose the likes of you mind the doctor. Let's 
be off; it is getting late. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Don't. Why not play on the road near this window? I 
could watch you then. </P>
<P class=h><B>Third Boy.</B> What can we play at here? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> With all these toys of mine lying about. Here you are, 
have them. I <PB N="56"></PB>can't play alone. They are getting dirty and are of 
no use to me. </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys.</B> How jolly! What fine toys! Look, here's a ship. There's 
old mother Jatai; say, chaps, ain't he a gorgeous sepoy? And you'll let us have 
them all? You don't really mind? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No, not a bit; have them by all means. </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys.</B> You don't want them back? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Oh, no, I shan't want them. </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys.</B> Say, won't you get a scolding for this? </P><PB 
N="57"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No one will scold me. But will you play with them in 
front of our door for a while every morning? I'll get you new ones when these 
are old. </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys.</B> Oh, yes, we will. Say, chaps, put these sepoys into a 
line. We'll play at war; where can we get a musket? Oh, look here, this bit of 
reed will do nicely. Say, but you're off to sleep already. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I'm afraid I'm sleepy. I don't know, I feel like it at 
times. I have been sitting a long while and I'm tired; my back aches. </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys</B> It's only early noon now. How is it you're sleepy? 
Listen! The gong's sounding the first watch. </P><PB N="58"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Yes, dong, dong, dong, it tolls me to sleep. </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys</B> We had better go then. We'll come in again to-morrow 
morning. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I want to ask you something before you go. You are 
always out--do you know of the King's postmen? </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys</B> Yes, quite well. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Who are they? Tell me their names. </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys</B> One's Badal, another's Sarat. There's so many of them. 
</P><PB N="59"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Do you think they will know me if there's a letter for 
me? </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys</B> Surely, if your name's on the letter they will find you 
out. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> When you call in to-morrow morning, will you bring one 
of them along so that he'll know me? </P>
<P class=h><B>Boys</B> Yes, if you like. </P><PRE>

<H2>ACT II</H2>
<P class=nh>[<I>Amal in Bed</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Can't I go near the window to-day, Uncle? Would the 
doctor mind that too? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Yes, darling, you see you've made yourself worse 
squatting there day after day. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Oh, no, I don't know if it's made me more ill, but I 
always feel well when I'm there. </P><PB N="64"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> No, you don't; you squat there and make friends with 
the whole lot of people round here, old and young, as if they are holding a fair 
right under my eaves--flesh and blood won't stand that strain. Just see--your 
face is quite pale. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Uncle, I fear my fakir'll pass and not see me by the 
window. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Your fakir, whoever's that? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> He comes and chats to me of the many lands where he's 
been. I love to hear him. </P><PB N="65"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> How's that? I don't know of any fakirs. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> This is about the time he comes in. I beg of you, by 
your dear feet, ask him in for a moment to talk to me here. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Gaffer Enters in a Fakir's Guise</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> There you are. Come here, Fakir, by my bedside. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Upon my word, but this is-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer</B> [<I>Winking hard</I>] I am the fakir. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> It beats my reckoning what you're not. </P><PB 
N="66"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Where have you been this time, Fakir? </P>
<P class=h><B>Fakir</B> To the Isle of Parrots. I am just back. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> The Parrots' Isle! </P>
<P class=h><B>Fakir.</B> Is it so very astonishing? Am I like you, man? A 
journey doesn't cost a thing. I tramp just where I like. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal</B> [<I>Clapping</I>] How jolly for you! Remember your 
promise to take me with you as your follower when I'm well. </P>
<P class=h><B>Fakir.</B> Of course, and I'll teach you such secrets too of 
travelling that nothing <PB N="67"></PB>in sea or forest or mountain can bar 
your way. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> What's all this rigmarole? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Amal, my dear, I bow to nothing in sea or mountain; 
but if the doctor joins in with this uncle of yours, then I with all my magic 
must own myself beaten. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No. Uncle shan't tell the doctor. And I promise to lie 
quiet; but the day I am well, off I go with the Fakir and nothing in sea or 
mountain or torrent shall stand in my way. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Fie, dear child, don't keep on harping upon going! It 
makes me so sad to hear you talk so. </P><PB N="68"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Tell me, Fakir, what the Parrots' Isle is like. </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> It's a land of wonders; it's a haunt of birds. There's 
no man; and they neither speak nor walk, they simply sing and they fly. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> How glorious! And it's by some sea? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Of course. It's on the sea. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> And green hills are there? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Indeed, they live among the green hills; and in the 
time of the sunset when there is a red glow on the hillside, all <PB 
N="69"></PB>the birds with their green wings flock back to their nests. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> And there are waterfalls! </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Dear me, of course; you don't have a hill without its 
waterfalls. Oh, it's like molten diamonds; and, my dear, what dances they have! 
Don't they make the pebbles sing as they rush over them to the sea. No devil of 
a doctor can stop them for a moment. The birds looked upon me as nothing but a 
man, quite a trifling creature without wings--and they would have nothing to do 
with me. Were it not so I would build a small cabin for myself among their crowd 
of nests and pass my days counting the sea waves. </P><PB N="70"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> How I wish I were a bird! Then-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> But that would have been a bit of a job; I hear you've 
fixed up with the dairyman to be a hawker of curds when you grow up; I'm afraid 
such business won't flourish among birds; you might land yourself into serious 
loss. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Really this is too much. Between you two I shall turn 
crazy. Now, I'm off. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Has the dairyman been, Uncle? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> And why shouldn't he? He won't bother his head running 
errands for your pet fakir, in and out among the <PB N="71"></PB>nests in his 
Parrots' Isle. But he has left a jar of curd for you saying that he is rather 
busy with his niece's wedding in the village, and he has got to order a band at 
Kamlipara. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> But he is going to marry me to his little niece. </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Dear me, we are in a fix now. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> He said she would find me a lovely little bride with a 
pair of pearl drops in her ears and dressed in a lovely red <I>sâree;</I> and in 
the morning she would milk with her own hands the black cow and feed me with 
warm milk with foam on it from a brand new earthen cruse; and in the evenings 
she would carry the lamp round the cow-house, and then <PB N="72"></PB>come and 
sit by me to tell me tales of Champa and his six brothers. </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> How delicious! The prospect tempts even me, a hermit! 
But never mind, dear, about this wedding. Let it be. I tell you when you wed 
there'll be no lack of nieces in his household. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Shut up! This is more than I can stand. [<I>Exit</I>] 
</P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Fakir, now that Uncle's off, just tell me, has the King 
sent me a letter to the Post Office? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> I gather that his letter has already started; but it's 
still on the way. </P><PB N="73"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> On the way? Where is it? Is it on that road winding 
through the trees which you can follow to the end of the forest when the sky is 
quite clear after rain? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> That's so. You know all about it already. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I do, everything. </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> So I see, but how? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I can't say; but it's quite clear to me. I fancy I've 
seen it often in days long gone by. How long ago I can't tell. <PB 
N="74"></PB>Do you know when? I can see it all: there, the King's postman coming 
down the hillside alone, a lantern in his left hand and on his back a bag of 
letters climbing down for ever so long, for days and nights, and where at the 
foot of the mountain the waterfall becomes a stream he takes to the footpath on 
the bank and walks on through the rye; then comes the sugarcane field and he 
disappears into the narrow lane cutting through the tall stems of sugarcanes; 
then he reaches the open meadow where the cricket chirps and where there is not 
a single man to be seen, only the snipe wagging their tails and poking at the 
mud with their bills. I can feel him coming nearer and nearer and my heart 
becomes glad. </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> My eyes aren't young; but you make me see all the 
same. </P><PB N="75"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Say, Fakir, do you know the King who has this Post 
Office? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> I do; I go to him for my alms every day. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Good! When I get well, I must have my alms too from him, 
mayn't I? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> You won't need to ask, my dear, he'll give it to you 
of his own accord. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No, I would go to his gate and cry, "Victory to thee, O 
King!" and dancing to the tabor's sound, ask for alms. Won't it be nice? </P><PB 
N="76"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> It would be splendid, and if you're with me, I shall 
have my full share. But what'll you ask? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I shall say, "Make me your postman, that I may go about 
lantern in hand, delivering your letters from door to door. Don't let me stay at 
home all day!" </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> What is there to be sad for, my child, even were you 
to stay at home? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> It isn't sad. When they shut me in here first I felt the 
day was so long. Since the King's Post Office I like it more and more being 
indoors, and as I think I shall get a letter one day, I feel quite happy and 
then I don't mind <PB N="77"></PB>being quiet and alone. I wonder if I shall 
make out what'll be in the King's letter? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Even if you didn't wouldn't it be enough if it just 
bore your name? </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Madhav enters</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Have you any idea of the trouble you've got me into, 
between you two? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> What's the matter? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> I hear you've let it get rumored about that the King 
has planted his office here to send messages to both of you. </P><PB 
N="78"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Well, what about it? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Our headman Panchanan has had it told to the King 
anonymously. </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Aren't we aware that everything reaches the King's 
ears? </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Then why don't you look out? Why take the King's name 
in vain? You'll bring me to ruin if you do. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Say, Fakir, will the King be cross? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Cross, nonsense! And with a child like you and a fakir 
such as I am. Let's <PB N="79"></PB>see if the King be angry, and then won't I 
give him a piece of my mind. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Say, Fakir, I've been feeling a sort of darkness coming 
over my eyes since the morning. Everything seems like a dream. I long to be 
quiet. I don't feel like talking at all. Won't the King's letter come? Suppose 
this room melts away all on a sudden, suppose-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer</B> [<I>Fanning Amal</I>] The letter's sure to come to-day, 
my boy. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Doctor enters</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Doctor</B> And how do you feel to-day? </P><PB N="80"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Feel awfully well to-day, Doctor. All pain seems to have 
left me. </P>
<P class=h><B>Doctor</B> [<I>Aside to Madhav</I>] Don't quite like the look of 
that smile. Bad sign that, his feeling well! Chakradhan has observed-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> For goodness sake, Doctor, leave Chakradhan alone. 
Tell me what's going to happen? </P>
<P class=h><B>Doctor.</B> Can't hold him in much longer, I fear! I warned you 
before--This looks like a fresh exposure. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> No, I've used the utmost care, never let him out of 
doors; and the windows have been shut almost all the time. </P><PB N="81"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Doctor.</B> There's a peculiar quality in the air to-day. As I 
came in I found a fearful draught through your front door. That's most hurtful. 
Better lock it at once. Would it matter if this kept your visitors off for two 
or three days? If someone happens to call unexpectedly--there's the back door. 
You had better shut this window as well, it's letting in the sunset rays only to 
keep the patient awake. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Amal has shut his eyes. I expect he is sleeping. His 
face tells me--Oh, Doctor, I bring in a child who is a stranger and love him as 
my own, and now I suppose I must lose him! </P>
<P class=h><B>Doctor.</B> What's that? There's your headman sailing in!--What a 
bother! I must <PB N="82"></PB>be going, brother. You had better stir about and 
see to the doors being properly fastened. I will send on a strong dose directly 
I get home. Try it on him--it may save him at last, if he can be saved at all. 
[<I>Exeunt Madhav and Doctor.</I>] </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>The Headman enters</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> Hello, urchin! </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer</B> [<I>Rising hastily</I>] 'Sh, be quiet. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No, Fakir, did you think I was asleep? I wasn't. I can 
hear everything; yes, and voices far away. I feel that mother and father are 
sitting by my pillow and speaking to me. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Madhav enters</I>] </P><PB N="83"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> I say, Madhav, I hear you hobnob with bigwigs 
nowadays. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Spare me your jests, Headman, we are but common 
people. </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> But your child here is expecting a letter from the 
King. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Don't you take any notice of him, a mere foolish boy! 
</P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> Indeed, why not! It'll beat the King hard to find a 
better family! Don't you see why the King plants his new Post Office right 
before your win- dow? Why there's a letter for you from the King, urchin. 
</P><PB N="84"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal</B> [<I>Starting up</I>] Indeed, really! </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> How can it be false? You're the King's chum. Here's 
your letter [<I>showing a blank slip of paper</I>]. Ha, ha, ha! This is the 
letter. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Please don't mock me. Say, Fakir, is it so? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Yes, my dear. I as Fakir tell you it is his letter. 
</P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> How is it I can't see? It all looks so blank to me. What 
is there in the letter, Mr. Headman? </P><PB N="85"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> The King says, "I am calling on you shortly; you had 
better arrange puffed rice offerings for me.--Palace fare is quite tasteless to 
me now." Ha! ha! ha! </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav</B> [<I>With folded palms</I>] I beseech you, headman, 
don't you joke about these things-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Cutting jokes indeed, dare he! </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> Are you out of your mind too, Gaffer? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Out of my mind, well then I am; I can read plainly 
that the King writes he will come himself to see Amal, with the state physician. 
</P><PB N="86"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Fakir, Fakir, 'sh, his trumpet! Can't you hear? </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> Ha! ha! ha! I fear he won't until he's a bit more off 
his head. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Mr. Headman, I thought you were cross with me and didn't 
love me. I never could think you would fetch me the King's letter. Let me wipe 
the dust off your feet. </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> This little child does have an instinct of reverence. 
Though a little silly, he has a good heart. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> It's hard on the fourth watch now, I suppose--Hark the 
gong, "Dong, <PB N="87"></PB>dong, ding," "Dong, dong, ding." Is the evening 
star up? How is it I can't see-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Oh, the windows are all shut, I'll open them. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>A knocking outside</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> What's that?--Who is it--what a bother! </P>
<P class=h><B>Voice</B> [<I>From outside</I>] Open the door. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav</B> Say, Headman--Hope they're not robbers. </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman</B> Who's there?--It's Panchanan, the headman, 
calls--Aren't you afraid of <PB N="88"></PB>the like of me? Fancy! The noise has 
ceased! Panchanan's voice carries far.--Yes, show me the biggest robbers! </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav</B> [<I>Peering out of the window</I>] I should think the 
noise has ceased. they've smashed the door. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>The King's Herald enters</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Herald.</B> Our Sovereign King comes to-night! </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> My God! </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> At what hour of the night, Herald? </P>
<P class=h><B>Herald.</B> On the second watch. </P><PB N="89"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> When from the city gates my friend the watchman will 
strike his gong, "ding dong ding, ding dong ding"--then? </P>
<P class=h><B>Herald.</B> Yes, then. The King sends his greatest physician to 
attend on his young friend. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>State Physician enters</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>State Physician.</B> What's this? How close it is here! Open wide 
all the doors and windows. [<I>Feeling Amal's body</I>] How do you feel, my 
child? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I feel very well, Doctor, very well. All pain is gone. 
How fresh and open! I can see all the stars now twinkling from the other side of 
the dark. </P><PB N="90"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> Will you feel well enough to leave your bed with 
the King when he comes in the middle watches of the night? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Of course, I'm dying to be about for ever so long. I'll 
ask the King to find me the polar star.--I must have seen it often, but I don't 
know exactly which it is. </P>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> He will tell you everything. [<I>To Madhav</I>] 
Will you go about and arrange flowers through the room for the King's visit? 
[<I>Indicating the Headman</I>] We can't have that person in here. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> No, let him be, Doctor. He is a friend. It was he who 
brought me the King's letter. </P><PB N="91"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> Very well, my child. He may remain if he is a 
friend of yours. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav</B> [<I>Whispering into Amal's ear</I>] My child, the King 
loves you. He is coming himself. Beg for a gift from him. You know our humble 
circumstances. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Don't you worry, Uncle.--I've made up my mind about it. 
</P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav.</B> What is it, my child? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> I shall ask him to make me one of his postmen that I may 
wander far and wide, delivering his message from door to door. </P><PB 
N="92"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Madhav</B> [<I>Slapping his forehead</I>] Alas, is that all? </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> What'll be our offerings to the King, Uncle, when he 
comes? </P>
<P class=h><B>Herald.</B> He has commanded puffed rice. </P>
<P class=h><B>Amal.</B> Puffed rice! Say, Headman, you're right. You said so. 
You knew all we didn't. </P>
<P class=h><B>Headman.</B> If you send word to my house then I could manage for 
the King's advent really nice-- </P>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> No need at all. Now be quiet all of you. Sleep is 
coming over him. I'll <PB N="93"></PB>sit by his pillow; he's dropping into 
slumber. Blow out the oil-lamp. Only let the star-light stream in. Hush, he 
slumbers. </P>
<P class=h><B>Madhav</B> [<I>Addressing Gaffer</I>] What are you standing there 
for like a statue, folding your palms.--I am nervous.--Say, are they good omens? 
Why are they darkening the room? How will star-light help? </P>
<P class=h><B>Gaffer.</B> Silence, unbeliever. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Sudha enters</I>] </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> Amal! </P>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> He's asleep. </P><PB N="94"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> I have some flowers for him. Mayn't I give them into 
his own hand? </P>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> Yes, you may. </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> When will he be awake? </P>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> Directly the King comes and calls him. </P>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> Will you whisper a word for me in his ear? </P>
<P class=h><B>Physician.</B> What shall I say? </P><PB N="95"></PB>
<P class=h><B>Sudha.</B> Tell him Sudha has not forgotten him. </P><PRE>

This file should be named poffi10h.txt or poffi10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, poffi11h.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, poffi10ah.txt

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
